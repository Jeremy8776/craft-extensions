//! Package contract for Craft extensions (themes, plug-ins, resources).
//!
//! Pure data and validation: no file system, no network, no clock. It builds for
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Everything that touches disk lives in `craft-ext-store`.
//!
//! Invariants:
//! - Every byte that reaches this crate is hostile: sizes are capped before parsing, ids and paths are
//!   checked by character class, and nothing here indexes with an untrusted number.
//! - A package never states its own trust. The tier is assigned by the host from where the package
//!   came, never read from the package.
//! - The third-party path is behind the `third-party` cargo feature, off by default.
